DIY face-mask in the time of COVID-19

In this period one of the greatest difficulties is finding protective masks, that's why people are making diy masks. As a Designer I decided to develop a low cost and easy to build mask, that have a low environmental impact too.

###### Instructions

    * Print the mask model, cut out the 3 parts and use them as templates to cut the cardboard.
    * Make holes on all the crossed cardboard parts.
    * By using the piece n.2 cuts the material found for the filter part of the same shape and creates a sandwich. I made 3 layers, baking paper - sterile gauze paper - baking paper. Block the filter layers by stapling the edges.

    * Put paper brass fastener on piece n2 and leave the flaps upwards.
    * Repeat the same operation for the filter part already made.
